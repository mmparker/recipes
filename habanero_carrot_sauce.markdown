Habanero-Carrot Hot Sauce
=========================

~10 habaneros (about half a pint chopped)
1 large carrot
1 Tbsp salt



Finely chop the chiles, put them in a pint mason jar, and add salt.  
Shake thoroughly.

Let sit at room temperature for around 12 hours to ferment a bit (because
that makes everything better).

Stir in the vinegar and loosely screw on the lid, then let the the mixture 
stand at room temperature for a week.

At the end of the week, blend it until smooth and strain into a clean glass
bottle. Enjoy!
