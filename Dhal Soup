Dhal Soup

With only one minor change (lime for lemon), this recipe is from the book
What's Cooking Vegetarian by Jenny Stacey. I love this book, because every recipe includes beautiful pictures.
Sadly, it doesn't have a great index so you have to hunt around a bit.

2 tbl butter
2 garlic cloves, crushed
1 onion, chopped (okay, I sliced it. I hate chopped onions)
½ tsp turmeric
1 tsp garam masala
¼ tsp chili powder
1 tsp ground cumin
2 cans of chopped tomatoes (14.5 ounces ea)
1 cup red lentils
Juice of ½ a lime
2½ cups veggie stock
1¼ cups coconut milk

Melt the butter (I used a little olive oil too, to keep the butter from scorching) in a large saucepan.
Saute the garlic and onion for 2-3 minutes.
Add the spices and cook for another 30 seconds.

Stir in the rest of the ingredients and bring to a boil.
Reduce heat to a simmer and cook for 25-30 minutes, until the lentils are tender.
