# Pie Crust

From Smitten Kitchen: http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2015/11/pecan-pie/


## Ingredients

 - 1 1/4 cups (155 grams) all-purpose flour
 - 1 1/2 teaspoons (6 grams) granulated sugar
 - 1/2 teaspoon (3 grams) fine sea or table salt
 - 1 stick (4 ounces or 115 grams) cold unsalted butter, cut into chunks
 - 1/4 cup (60 ml) very cold water, plus an additional tablespoon if needed
 
 
## Make the pie dough

**By hand, with my one-bowl method:** In the bottom of a large bowl, combine the flour, salt and sugar. Work the butter into the 
flour with your fingertips or a pastry blender until mixture resembles a coarse meal and the largest bits of butter are the size
of tiny peas. (Some people like to do this by freezing the stick of butter and coarsely grating it into the flour, but I haven’t
found the results as flaky.) Add 1/4 cup cold water and stir with a spoon or flexible silicone spatula until large clumps form.
Use your hands to knead the dough together, right in the bottom of the bowl. If necessary to bring the dough together, you can
add the last tablespoon of water.

**With a food processor:** In the work bowl of a food processor, combine flour, salt and sugar. Add butter and pulse machine until 
mixture resembles a coarse meal and the largest bits of butter are the size of tiny peas. Turn mixture out into mixing bowl.
Add 1/4 cup cold water and stir with a spoon or flexible silicone spatula until large clumps form. Use your hands to knead the
dough together, right in the bottom of the bowl. If necessary to bring the dough together, you can add the last tablespoon of water.


## Rest the dough

Both methods: Wrap dough in a sheet of plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least one hour, or up to 48 hours, or you can quick-firm this in the freezer for 15 minutes. Longer than 2 days, it’s best to freeze it until needed.

## Form the crust

On a floured counter, roll the dough out into a 12 to 13-inch circle-ish shape. Fold dough gently in quarters without creasing and transfer to a 9-inch standard (not deep-dish) pie plate. Unfold dough and trim overhang to about 1/2-inch. Fold overhang under edge of pie crust and crimp decoratively. If not parbaking, place in fridge until ready to fill. If parbaking, place in freezer for 20 minutes, until solid.

## Par-bake the crust: 

[Optional, but will lead to a crispier base.] Heat oven 400°F (205°C). Line frozen crust with lightly buttered or oiled foil. Fill with pie weights, dried beans or pennies. Bake on a rimmed baking sheet for 20 minutes. Carefully remove foil and weights and let cool a little before filling.
