### Batch A
0.5 cups habaneros
1 tbsp. salt
White vinegar until total volume is 1.5 cups


### Batch B
69g habaneros
54g Red Dragon carrots
White vinegar until total volume is 1.5 cups


I sure took terrible fuckin' notes on these.



### Habanero-Carrot Hot Sauce
~10 habaneros (about half a pint chopped) 
1 large carrot 
1 Tbsp salt

Finely chop the chiles, put them in a pint mason jar, and add salt.
Shake thoroughly.

Let sit at room temperature for around 12 hours to ferment a bit (because that makes everything better).

Stir in the vinegar and loosely screw on the lid, then let the the mixture stand at room temperature for a week.

At the end of the week, blend it until smooth and strain into a clean glass bottle. Enjoy!
